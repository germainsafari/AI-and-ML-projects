# Step 1: Connect to Azure Blob Storage and retrieve documents

# Step 2: Preprocess the data

# Step 3: Feature Extraction
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=10000, stop_words='english')
X = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(preprocessed_documents)
y = labels  # Assuming you have labels for your documents

# Step 4: Train the Model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

svm_classifier = SVC(kernel='linear')
svm_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 5: Evaluate the Model
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

y_pred = svm_classifier.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Step 6: Deploy the Model
# Once you're satisfied with the model's performance, you can save it and deploy it for inference on new documents.
